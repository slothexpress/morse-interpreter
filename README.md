# Morse Code Interpreter
This console application is part of my course in Test Automation and Test Driven Development. 
The application allows the user to either translate from text to morse code or from morse code to text.
It follows the [morse code](https://morsecode.world/international/morse2.html) 
international standard.

## How to run
Requirements: Java 11 and Maven 3. 

Use your preferred IDEA (e.g. IntelliJ) to run the application.

## How to use
The user will be provided with two options: interpretation to morse code or from morse code.

The application can handle input such as: letters A-Z, digits, period, comma and question mark.

For morse code representation, short signal is represented by asterisk (*) and long signal is represented by dash (-).

Additionally, semicolon has been selected to represent a space when interpreting from morse to text.
